            Hello. My name is Senator Horton. Yes, Senator is my actual first name. Why? My dad thought it would be funny and help me stand out.
            Well, it helps for reservations at restaurants and getting reserved parking spaces, so mission accomplished I guess. This site is
            meant to be a place where I can share my thoughts and ideas with the world as well as serve as a portfolio of sorts. I'm a big fan of
            programming, web development, and game design, so you'll see a lot of that here.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some interests of mine include: shredding on my guitar, DMing D&D games for my friends (I've been running the same campaign for 3 years
            now), Warhammer 40k, playing and making video games, app development, and trying to sate my hunger for knowledge.
